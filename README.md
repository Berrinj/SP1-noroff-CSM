## Acknowledgments

Want to thank my fellow students that took the time to test my site when shared in our
discord group.
Also a thank you to Richard, a back-end friend that went through my site and came back with
feedback that was great for improvements on my site, like the google calender error and how
he as a user interpreted the website.
Thanks to family members and friends that checked the site out.



## Full Project Brief
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

You have been provided media assets as text and images (see link under Resources). It is for you to decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.

Project Description
Based on the first-semester curriculum, the semester project should reflect the student’s creative and technical knowledge and skills. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and development with HTML/CSS.

Target Audience & Design: The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A website prototype should be made using your chosen software (Adobe XD, Figma etc.)

Final Product: A URL and zip file with the final website should be submitted. The site should be tested on a variety of devices before final delivery. The student is responsible for setting up their web host or using Netlify to deploy the site. GitHub repositories should be set to public.

Report: Submit a report discussing the design and technical aspects of the project, as well as how guidelines for WCAG, SEO and content management were handled. A template for this report is provided under ‘Resources’.

The duration of the Semester Project is four weeks (full-time) and eight weeks (part-time).

Requirements:
- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
